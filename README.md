# odin-landing-page
This webpage was created by referencing a picture of a webpage and style guide provided by the odin project.<br/>

Laying out the elements and styling them was pretty straightforward but my biggest challenge with this project was making the webpage look presentable on all devices. Even if my practices in achieving presentability weren't the best, I wanted to be thorough before moving on with the odin curriculum. <br/>

I might come back to this project when I have more experience.
